// The global text map defines a map of text sizings, with their corresponding
// font sizes, and optionally line-height and letter spacing.
//
// A responsive map can be provided to change these text sizings at different
// breakpoints, allowing for a uniform website that grows and shrinks across
// devices. All text sizes are mobile-first, and go from the breakpoint upwards.
//
// ONLY access this map using the mixins in _tools.text-functions.scss.
// There are also helper classes for u-text in _utilities.type.scss, which allow
// the use of .u-text--${size} and .u-text--responsive to add the below styles.
