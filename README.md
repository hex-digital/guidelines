# Hex Guidelines

Welcome to the Hex Guidelines repo.

There can be a lot to remember across all our different projects and
repositories, like contribution process, coding standards, pull request guidance
and more, so this repo attempts to keep that information altogether and easy to
access.

Please read and try to adhere to these, and feel free to come back at any time
to refresh.
